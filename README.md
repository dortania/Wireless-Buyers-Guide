# Wireless Buyers Guide

So you've finally installed macOS onto your desktop/laptop/smart fridge, but you look towards the menubar and see a Bluetooth icon yet no wifi to go with. You immediately bolt to the Settings pane and see no Wi-Fi option and wonder where you may have gone wrong in your install. Scowering the inter-webs did provide an answer, but it was not that which you wanted to hear: "Your Wi-Fi card is SHIT anon!" said some user on a forum with far too many ads and a broken layout. They then proceeded to tell you how stupid you were to even think your wireless card would work. "How dare you not have the knowledge of Hackintosh hive mind!" This page should help clear some things up.
