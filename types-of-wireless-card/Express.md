# Express cards

So this is also a really bad idea but I accidentally found Express Card-based wireless cards searching for other cards:

Up to High Sierra:
* AR9280
   * Ubiquiti Networks SR71-X
   
   
With this model, you'll need to reinject the old AirPortAtheros40 plugin used in High Sierra to work in Mojave
