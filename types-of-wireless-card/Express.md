# Express cards

So this is also a really bad idea, but I accidentally found Express Card-based wireless cards searching for other cards:

Up to High Sierra:

* **Atheros AR9280**
  * Ubiquiti Networks SR71-X (802.11 a/b/g/n, 2x2)

With this model, you'll need to reinject the old AirPortAtheros40 plugin used in High Sierra to work in Mojave.
